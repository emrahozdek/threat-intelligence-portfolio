# Threat-intelligence-portfolio
This is a hands-on portfolio documenting my journey into Threat Intelligence and Data Analysis. It includes real-world data sets that combine:
- Data analysis and visualization (Tableau, Python, Pandas, Altair)
- Threat actor research and IOC mapping
- Simulated attack investigations with visual storytelling
